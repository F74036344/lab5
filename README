I use a character vector to store the value which
out of the range of an integer.

Operator overloaded: <<  >>  +  -

***I don't know why but it seems that something is wrong

with my function operator+. when it outputs result from addition,

it prints something peculiar like "????"

The program even collapsed when I tried to execute 

the following sentence:

	cout << x+y;	//directly output the result of addition 
			//instead of storing it into result. 

I don't know why the bug appears :(
